### üîÑ Workflow Transformation

#### Before Consolidation:
1. User wants to switch from weekly to monthly view
2. Looks for view switching controls (multiple locations)
3. Finds different controls in header, sidebar, or inline
4. Clicks control but unsure if it worked (inconsistent feedback)
5. Checks multiple locations to confirm current view
6. Repeats process for date navigation
7. Gets confused by different date picker implementations
8. Loses context when switching between views
9. Must reorient after each navigation action

#### After Consolidation:
1. User wants to switch from weekly to monthly view
2. Looks at primary navigation (always in same location)
3. Clicks clearly labeled "Monthly" button
4. Receives immediate visual feedback (consistent active state)
5. Context preserved during transition
6. Date navigation uses same unified controls
7. Breadcrumbs show current location
8. Can easily return to previous view if needed
