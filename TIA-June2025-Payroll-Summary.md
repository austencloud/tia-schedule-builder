## Recommendations

1. **Redistribute Workload:** Several staff members are significantly over-scheduled while others are completely unused
2. **Utilize Available Staff:** Morph, Cam, Courtney, Ruby, and Donnie are available but not scheduled
3. **Review Scheduling Patterns:** Current scheduling may lead to burnout for over-utilized staff
4. **Cost Optimization:** Better distribution could maintain coverage while reducing overtime costs

## Important Notes

- **Data Limitation:** Analysis based on only 5 days of schedule data (17% of month)
- **Projection Method:** Linear extrapolation assuming consistent patterns
- **Excluded Staff:** Outside educators (Gregg, Ari, Catherine, Shannon) not included due to percentage-based compensation
- **Actual Results:** May vary based on events, holidays, and schedule adjustments throughout the month
