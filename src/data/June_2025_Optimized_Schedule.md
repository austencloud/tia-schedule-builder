## Coverage Gap Analysis

### ✅ Requirements Met
- **Monday/Tuesday:** 2 animal care certified staff (11 AM - 1 PM) ✓
- **Wednesday:** Animal care coverage (1-3 PM), front desk (3-8 PM) ✓
- **Thursday-Sunday:** Full operations coverage (11 AM - 8 PM) ✓
- **Minimum 2 people on-site:** Always maintained ✓
- **Animal care + front desk trained:** Always present ✓
- **Lab + front desk OR 2 front desk:** Always covered ✓
- **Minimum 3-hour shifts:** All shifts meet requirement ✓

### ⚠️ Potential Considerations
- **Special Events:** May require additional coverage (flagged for review)
- **Classroom Conflicts:** When basement booked, lab staff moves to front desk
- **Peak Days:** Saturday/Sunday have 3-person coverage for flexibility

## Efficiency Recommendations

### 1. Schedule Optimization
- **Reduce Wednesday/Thursday/Friday hours** if budget needs tightening
- **Cross-train volunteers** in basic front desk duties
- **Implement staggered breaks** during peak hours

### 2. Staff Development
- **Accelerate trainee progression** to reduce supervision needs
- **Cross-train animal care staff** in lab basics
- **Develop Morph's animal handling skills** for backup coverage

### 3. Classroom Conflict Management
- **Schedule lab work** around known classroom bookings
- **Create mobile lab setups** for upstairs work when needed
- **Coordinate with event planning** to minimize conflicts

### 4. Cost Management Strategies
- **Maximize volunteer hours** during peak periods
- **Implement performance incentives** rather than across-the-board raises
- **Consider part-time benefits** for high-hour staff

## Implementation Notes

1. **Training Schedule:** Emilie and Cam require supervision - paired with experienced staff
2. **Volunteer Coordination:** Courtney, Emily, and Reece scheduled for maximum impact
3. **Flexibility Built-in:** Weekend 3-person coverage allows for adjustments
4. **Special Events:** Additional staffing needs flagged for separate planning

## Next Steps

1. **Review wage assumptions** with actual payroll data
2. **Confirm staff availability** for assigned shifts
3. **Implement 2-week trial** of new schedule
4. **Monitor coverage effectiveness** and adjust as needed
5. **Plan special event staffing** separately from regular schedule
