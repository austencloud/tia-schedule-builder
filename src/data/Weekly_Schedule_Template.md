## Special Considerations

### Classroom Booking Conflicts
**When basement classroom is booked:**
- Lab staff (Athena, Bayla, Rob) move upstairs to cover front desk/animal care
- Adjust lab schedules to prevent overstaffing
- Maintain minimum 2-person coverage at all times

### Peak Period Adjustments
**High-volume days (weekends):**
- 3-person coverage provides flexibility
- Volunteers scheduled for additional support
- Cross-trained staff can cover multiple areas

### Cost Optimization
**Lower-volume days (Wed/Thu/Fri):**
- Reduced staffing as requested
- Volunteer hours maximized
- Higher-paid staff limited to essential coverage

2. **Lab Staff Absence:** Rob, Athena, Bayla can substitute for each other
